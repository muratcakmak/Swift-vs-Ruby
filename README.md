# Swift-vs-Rubys

## Comments
Both languages support one-line and multi-line comments
```
# Ruby 

=begin
  multi-line 
  code comment
=end


// Swift 

/*
  multi-line
  code comment
*/
```


## Constant and Variable declaration
Ruby doesn't have constant. Swift does.

```
# Ruby
legal_age = 18

// Swift 

let legalAge = 18 //This is a constant

var currentAge = 27 //This is variable

```
